Like it was so difficult to create all those complex shapes only using numbers but it was also the best lesson because of how cool the shapes looked afterward.

It was difficult because of how even spelling one woed wrong would make your entire code wrong, and it was frustrating when you could not where you went wrong. 5/2/2024</p><p> </p><h4>Overall I enjoyed Computers this year and the fact that it is the last year that i'm doing it is really sad but I think I really did learn something that I can use when i'm older. I really did enjoy having Mr Boon as a teacher because of how fun he makes the lesssons even with his dad jokes that are totally funny! Computers was a subject that I would've chosen if I could.</h4><p> </p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://imangemerrifield.github.io/myportfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://imangemerrifield.github.io/myportfolio/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
